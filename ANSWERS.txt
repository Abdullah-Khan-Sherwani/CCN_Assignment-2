1. Latency Comparison:
UDP has a lower latency on average when compared with TCP. This is because UDP does not have the overhead of establishing and 
maintaining a connection, which can lead to higher latency. TCP on average has a latency (RTT) of 0.000066 sec and UDP had latency
0.000045 sec. In the code provided latency and throughput vary with tcp and udp both having minute differences in latency and 
throughput. This is due to the nature of the network and the specific conditions of the test. However, in general, UDP tends to have 
lower latency than TCP.

2. Reliability and Packet Loss:
Nothing happens when UDP packets are lost and they are not retransmitted.
TCP ensures all packets arrive correctly since that is its design goal. It is used in applications which do not tolerate packet loss
such as email delivery therefore it ensures all packets are delivered using different mechanisms such as checksums, ACKs, and 
retransmission

3. Throughput Analysis:
UDP is faster for bulk data transfer since it is not hindered by retransmissions, and other overheads. Although UDP is faster, it is 
less reliable than TCP and if the data is loss intolerant then TCP should be used instead of UDP.
TCP introduces overhead due to acknowledgements (ACKs) since every packet requires an ACK to be received and if an ACK is not recieved,
is corrupted, or is duplicated, or is lost, then TCP retranmits the packet which can lead to duplicate packets and cause congestion
and increase overhead.

4. Use Cases:
TCP should be used when the data being transferred is loss intolerant and UDP should be used where fast transmission is requuired and
data loss can be tolerated.
TCP can be used in applications such as emails , file transfers, and web browsing. UDP can be used in applications such as
 video streaming and online gaming.
